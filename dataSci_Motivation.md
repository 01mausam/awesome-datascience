Awesome #DataScience Motivation

*This repo for dummies who are new on Data Science*

This is shortcut path to start studying on #DataScience . Just follow steps to understand "What is Data Science and What should study to learn Data Science?"

 * First of all, Data Science is hot topic on Computer and Internet farmland. People created pretty much data from applications and systems until now and time to analyze them. Producing suggestions from these datas and creating predictions about future are the next step. You can find [here](http://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science)  biggest question for #DataScience ever and hundreds of answers from experts. My favorite data scientist is [Clare Corthell](https://twitter.com/clarecorthell). She is expert of data related systems and hacker, now she has been working on a company as a DataScientist. Clara's [blog](http://datasciencemasters.org/). This web site helps you to understand exact way to study as a professional data scientist. 
 * Secondly, My favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays. Because Python - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library have fully functionality to collecting data and analyzing. I use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) to play data and to create applications. I shared some [Twitter](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/dataSci_twitter_accounts.md) and [Facebook](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/dataSci_facebook_groups.md) accounts on [this](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience) repo, you can follow these accounts and improve your data science knowledge. 
 * Finally, you feel free to ask anything about #DataScience. You can find my email on my [github account](https://github.com/erolrecep).
