# DataScience Project Life Cycle

DataScience is the one of the most popular method to achieve meaning from the data. Hundreds of tools and algorithms have been using for many years. But nowadays, experts accept the method of **DataScience** become easiest way with the spreading of many kinds of science area.

## Identify the Problem

Finding mysterious problems to analyze your system and acquire suggesting or predicting results from your stored data. [Stories](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Identifying-Problems.md) are being told!

## Find available data source

Data is the blood of your system.  [Here](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience#data-sets) is the blood donation box.

## Data Munging - Statistical analyse

Make your data readable and prepare to use in your system properly. So this step is most important part of your process. This [page](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/DataMunging.md) can be good list for you!  

## Apply Algorithm to fix problem

Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms can be used to fix the problem. Engineers are working to find best [algorithms](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Algorithms.md) to find best results!

## Visualize the process

Visualization tools are creating and sharing every day in the Internet. But, in fact, **Visualization** is  a kind of Art and lots of visualization artists are creating and developing visualization tools day by day. Look at this [page](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Visualization.md)! You will find magnificent visualization tool to make your project masterpiece.

## Report your result and Maintenance 

 Project has not finished yet. This step makes your system **dynamic** and helps your results alive. Do you know how can you [report](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/Report-your-result.md) you results ?
