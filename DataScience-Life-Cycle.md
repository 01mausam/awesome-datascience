#DataScience Project Life Cycle

 * ## 1 - Identify the Problem

Finding suitable problem to analyze your system and attempt to fix what you find. 

 * ## 2 - Find available data source

Data is the blood of your system.  

 * ## 3 - Data Munging Statistical analyse

Make your data readable and prepare to use in your system properly. 

 * ## 4 - Apply Algorithm to fix problem

Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms can use to fix the problem. Many algorithms have been using in this step.  

 * ## 5 - Visualize the process

Visualization tools are creating and sharing every day in the Internet. But, in fact, **Visualization** is  a kind of Art and lots of artists are creating and developing visualization tools day by day.

 * ## 6 - Report your result and Maintenance 

 Project has not finished yet. This step makes your system **dynamic** and helps your results to keep alive.
